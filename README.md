### Blockchain Identity And Voting Systems Can Ensure Fair Elections

    
Given advances in electoral technology aimed at combating electoral threats, blockchain-based mobile voting applications are a way to address the challenges of preventing vote-rigging, voter fraud, and voter suppression. Because current voting systems are so flawed and scrutinized, blockchains aim to introduce a new way of voting and communicating between people and their friends and family members in real time.

Blockchain advocates say the technology addresses the problem that voting can be controlled by a single person or group of machines. If an electoral system fulfils these characteristics, voters and their election observers, who check the election results, need not worry about the software used in the election. Pret is used in controlled environments such as polling stations and offers stronger security guarantees than internet voting systems.

Similarly, free and fair democracy cannot be guaranteed by the conduct of elections alone; a blockchain-based electoral system can guarantee free and fair elections without the need for an electronic system to guarantee the integrity of the elections. [Sources: 11, 14] 
    
However, I believe that the technology being considered here at Jolie, blockchain identity and voting systems, is worth considering because it could show how trust in our electoral system is already working and how it could be built in the future. [Sources: 13] 
    
Blockchain could be used to hedge against manipulation by those who would try to influence an election (see Zcash). This also applies to the fact that the user can check on the voting blockchain whether the ballot paper has been delivered by an eligible voter without having to reveal the identity of the voter. If we choose to do so, we would also allow voters to check ballot papers at the ballot boxes to confirm that the totals reported by the blockchain voting system are correct without revealing their identity. We could go further and use this in the future so that when people vote, they can easily check for ballot papers that have been cast by eligible voters without having to reveal the identity of the voters. The electoral blockchain would then be able to identify citizens who cast legitimate votes by checking transactions and the identity chain. [Sources: 4, 9, 16] 
    
In this way, a blockchain-based voting system delivers real-time results and ensures that the count is foolproof. Blockchain also ensures that an entire election can be easily monitored and electoral fraud becomes impossible because every vote is verified as genuine. If you look closely at Russia's blockchain remote-voting solution, the authorities say that blockchain technology ensures the security of the process and the complete anonymity of voters. Blockchain does not allow anyone to manipulate the results; blockchain only works when the votes are cast and the counting is done. However, if the voting terminals are not secured, blockchain can be effective. [Sources: [3](https://impakter.com/agora/), 6, 15] 
    
Electronic voting, including blockchain-based systems, are the most secure because of paper security systems and vvpat. The blockchain-based voting system currently proposed in the US uses voters "personal devices that are used for other functions and are not considered secure. When voters receive a cryptographic key, hackers can focus on compromising the key by altering votes after it has been blocked and seeing votes tied to the voter's identity, raising privacy concerns. In the past, cryptographic keys have been compromised and hackers have compromised these keys as well as other electronic voting systems. [Sources: 10] 
    
Blockchain technology secures voting systems through cryptography and decentralization, and many advocates of modernizing voting use the same technology that underlies cryptocurrencies and distributed applications to create tamper-proof, permanent voting documents. If a blockchain voting system is designed and implemented correctly, it could be the most secure, secure, and secure electronic voting method ever implemented. [Sources: 5, 9, 15] 
    
A blockchain voting system would distribute voting vouchers to eligible voters who would spend them to cast their vote for the candidate they elected. The entire process is recorded on the blockchain, meaning that voters in most current elections can check that their votes actually count. Votes would be stored not only as votes in Voigt's permitted blockchain, but also on a secure, permanent record of the voter's identity and voting history. This would ensure that the vote would be untampered with, while separating it from the voters "identities.

By allowing voters to see the number of votes that are received, and making it transparent and trustworthy as an electoral system, everyone will be able to "recognize" the legitimacy of the vote. In postal voting, verifying the identity of voters and states that guarantee the traceability of each vote is crucial to preventing voter fraud.

For many reasons, including blockchain voting, citizen-supported blockchain technology could be useful in many ways.
