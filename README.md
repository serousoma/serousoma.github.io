### Donald Trump - Fraud, Con, Dangerous Psychotic, Racist, Criminal.




#aliens #arrest #bragging #millions 
        
Trump has publicly bragged to his supporters that there will be mass arrests across the United States where millions of "illegal aliens" will be put in his concentration camps. [3] He played his goon card, bragging that his ICE shock - troops would round up millions of "illegal" ( black and brown ) immigrants across the country in the upcoming weeks. [3]

Donald Trump's regime is planning to use the Insurrection Act to allow the U.S. military to operate across this country, particularly in major Democratic - controlled cities, to arrest and imprison black and brown "illegal aliens. [3] He wallowed in racist lies about threatening and dangerous "illegal aliens" and how the Democrats want to let them run amok, raping, killing and otherwise preying upon "real Americans" -- primarily meaning white women. [3]

    If Donald Trump orders his followers to "fight back," there will be a wave of domestic terrorism in the United States. [3]
        
    Gartner is also the founder of the Duty to Warn PAC, an organization working to raise awareness about the danger to the United States and the world posed by Donald Trump. [3]
        
    The reality is that the United States may be getting to a point where there will not be another free and fair election because of Russian hacking and Donald Trump and the Republican Party's unwillingness to protect the country. [3]
        
    Yet the US was on a virtuous path to containment and suppression when Trump intervened and put pressure on states to open up. [7]
        
    If Trump is removed from office -- either through impeachment or the 2020 election -- I have no doubt he will cause mayhem in this country. [3]
        
    


#vote #racist #supporters #country 
        
    Racists now are probably 3 % of the country, but, of course, the racists were not voting Democrat, so their percentage within the Trump vote would be nearly twice their percentage within the country. [5]
        
    Mr. Trump is not a racist, Jeff Sessions is not a racist, and no one in Trump's cabinet appears to be a racist. [5]
        
    If you add Trump's supporters and Bernie's supporters, you 've got 65, 70 % of the country, and this is the point upon which they agree. [5]
        
    About 174 million Americans either voted against him or didn't vote for him, which is about 73 % of the eligible - to - vote American population. [9]
        
    As to how many of Trump's supporters are racist, I don't know and you don't know, and your guess is probably as good as mine. [5]

    As the polling company reports : "President Donald Trump's attacks on the 'mainstream media' are likely a factor in the increasingly polarized views of the media. [6]
        
    He said there is a whole industry around Donald Trump that's committed to keeping him in his dream, meaning Fox News and the right - wing news media echo chamber. [3]
        
    In a recent report of audiences for cable news programs, those carried on MSNBC and CNN fell out of the top slots. [6]
        
    


#president #says #disturbed 
        
    So at this point the Democrats are overtly saying that Donald Trump is psychologically impaired and so sick and disturbed that he is actually incapable of doing his job. [3]
        
    According to witnesses, Donald Trump, the president of the United States, literally bangs the table and walks out without having a conversation. [3]
        
    To say that Trump has quasi - fascist ideas is not to condemn him, in my view, because I believe that all Presidents have quasi - fascist tendencies. [5]
        
    Their conclusion, based on the hundreds of hours of Trump's on - camera dialogue and off - the - cuff public speaking, is alarming because it says that our current president is too mentally disturbed to fulfill his office. [4]
        
    For some time mental health professionals have publicly been trying to sound the alarm about Donald Trump and how he should be removed from the presidency under the 25th Amendment. [3]
        
    


#alt #Daily #Stormer 
        
    The Daily Stormer was unlike anything else in white nationalism : The design was clean, the posts were infused with Anglin's wry humor. [1]
        
    The election helped elevate The Daily Stormer from one of several influential white - nationalist sites to a key platform of the alt - right, though the site wasn't nearly as popular as Anglin wanted people to think. [1]
        
    The calls marked the start of a months - long campaign of harassment orchestrated by Andrew Anglin, the publisher of the world's biggest neo - Nazi website, The Daily Stormer. [1]
        
    Anglin is the alt - right's most accomplished propagandist, and his writing taps into some of the same anxieties and resentments that helped carry Trump to the presidency -- chiefly a perceived loss of status among white men. [1]
        
    


#protesters #gathered #Greg #Burkholder #described 
        
    Among the protesters in the rain outside Greg's office, I met Anglin's preschool teacher, Gail Burkholder, who described being shocked when she 'd learned that her former student had grown up to be a notorious white nationalist. [1]
        
    Those donations went to Greg's office, which was why the protesters had gathered outside, many of them from the Columbus chapter of Anti - Racist Action, a national antifascist network. [1]
        
    On a rainy Saturday, about 45 protesters, some with black masks covering their faces, gathered outside a drab two - story building in Worthington, a suburb of Columbus, where Anglin's father, Greg, runs a Christian counseling service. [1]
        
    


#book #Minnesota #March 
        
    About 700 people gathered at the Minnesota capitol building in St. Paul, Minnesota, on March 4th, 2017, to show support for Donald Trump. [0]
        
    Her mission in the book to be published on 28 July by Simon & Schuster is to take down Donald Trump. [7]
        
    In March 2007, Anglin published his first post about Donald Trump, highlighting a video clip from a 2000 roast of Rudy Giuliani. [1]
        
    Mary Trump subsequently handed over 19 boxes of papers, plus computer files, to the New York Times after Trump was elected president. [7]
        
    That was from Chris Megerian at the Los Angeles Times - Niece's book says Trump views 'cheating as a way of life '. [7]
        
    In May 2016, CNN's Wolf Blitzer had asked then - candidate Trump about the death threats and harassment Anglin's army had leveled against the journalist Julia Ioffe after she wrote a profile of Melania Trump for GQ magazine. [1]
        
    


#Putin #Vladimir #act #want #message 
        
    They want to have it both ways; they want to send one message when they act as the European Union, but a contradictory message when they act as NATO. [5]
        
    He developed an almost religious infatuation with Vladimir Putin, or "Czar Putin I, defender of human civilization," as Anglin called him. [1]
        
    The news that he may have failed to take note of intelligence reports that suggested that Vladimir Putin had offered bounties for the deaths of American soldiers in Afghanistan makes him a national security risk. [7]
        
    


#psychologists #Personality #Disorder #Goldwater #John 
        
    Malignant Narcissism, according to John D. Gartner, one of the country's top psychologists, is basically a combination of three mental illnesses -- Anti - social Personality Disorder, Paranoid Personality Disorder, and Narcissistic Personality Disorder -- plus sadism, or the enjoyment of inflicting pain. [4]
        
    Psychologists say that Trump's condition is a combination of mental disorders that cause one to distort reality and make violent, impulsive decisions. [4]
        
    In an effort to answer these questions, I recently spoke with Dr. John Gartner, a former professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University Medical School. [3]
        
    In recent years, psychologists have found a powerful connection between trolling and what's known as the "dark tetrad" of personality traits : psychopathy, sadism, narcissism, and Machiavellianism. [1]
        
    After Barry Goldwater won a 1969 defamation lawsuit when psychiatrists called him crazy in Fact magazine, the psychiatric community put in place a "Goldwater Rule" in their ethics handbook that forbids diagnosing public figures. [4]
        
    


#Fred #Mary #brother 
        
    Donald Trump has two elder sisters and an elder brother, Frederick Trump Jr ( b. 1938 ) who had two children, Mary Lea Trump ( b. 1965 ) and Fred III. [7]
        
    Donald Trump ( b. 1946 ) is the fourth ( of five ) child of Frederick Christ Trump, a Bronx - born real estate developer whose parents were German immigrants and Scottish - born Mary Anne MacLeod Trump. [7]
        
    First, Mary Trump and her brother Fred III contested the will, saying they had been seriously dudded, which, on the face of it, seems true. [7]
        
    Mary Trump was 16 in 1981 when her father Fred Trump Jr died of a heart attack, brought on by severe alcoholism for which he had been hospitalised. [7]
        
    


#things #believe #ideas #friend 
        
    Your failure to come forward with new ideas, I think, is among the things which frankly has driven the Democratic Party to the edge of Irrelevance in the center of the country. [5]
        
    I am trying to speak to you as a friend, but not too good of a friend, not a friend who will go get drunk with you, but a friend who will tell you that you have had one too many and are making a fool of yourself. [5]
        
    You didn't get on board, because you were kidding yourselves about what a great thing this was going to be for the Democratic Party. [5]
        
    But the lack of confidence in the viability of their ideas, in a contest of ideas, has let in the kudzu vine of political consultants. [5]
        
    


#racist #start #call #N #word 
        
    I will not use the N word even for purposes of illustration, but let us pretend that the N word is "Nashville ". [5]
        
    If 2,000 of us start yelling "racist" at Bill Gates, you're going to think "maybe it is not so bad, to be called a racist. [5]
        
    But beyond that, what happens if I and 2,000 of my close friends start calling someone that you admire a racist. . [5]
        
    If you call someone a ( insert racist slur here ) or you unfairly call them a racist or anything else profoundly insulting, isn't that the same thing? [5]
        
    I am old enough to remember when the real racists could control those who started to leave to the fold by calling them Nashville Lovers. [5]
        
    


#Nazi #Hitler #Jews #Holocaust #neo 
        
    Devon Arthurs, an 18-year - old former neo - Nazi who converted to Islam, shot and killed two of his three roommates in Tampa, who were still neo - Nazis. [1]
        
    Anglin named his new site after Der Sturmer, a virulently anti - Semitic Nazi - era weekly that Hitler had read devoutly. [1]
        
    Some deny that the Holocaust occurred, contending that it was an elaborate ruse designed to let Jews play victims at the expense of everyone else. [1]
        
    Everyone who 'd known Anglin when he was young seemed to wonder the same thing : What had happened to turn him into a neo - Nazi? [1]
        
    Greg had amassed a sizable, if shabby, real - estate portfolio in town, and I visited several of his properties, trying, unsuccessfully, to locate his neo - Nazi son. [1]
        
    


#spring #floated #Europe #reason #motion 
        
    For years he floated around Europe, and one family member told me that around 2015 he was holed up in Russia, his last known foreign address. [1]
        
    I 'd learned that Anglin might be in town for a legal hearing -- for some reason, he 'd filed a motion to expunge his 2006 misdemeanor drug conviction -- and I intended to approach him at the courthouse. [1]
        
    


#Columbus #Greg #bars #Ohio 
        
    I was staying near the old Exile bar, once the premier leather joint in Columbus and an early moneymaker for the Anglin family. [1]
        
    Columbus, Ohio, is a funky, still kind - of gritty city, and I went there in January looking for clues to Anglin's past. [1]
        
    The Exile was one of two gay bars that had been owned by Anglin's uncle Todd until he died of aids, after which Greg took over. [1]
        
    A person who was close to one of Greg's former clients, along with two Columbus pastors familiar with Greg's work as a counselor, told me that Greg got involved emotionally, and sometimes sexually, with his female clients. [1]
        
    He remembers Anglin once picking up a 14-year - old in a bar and bringing her back to the Sampaguita to spend the night. [1]
        
    


#Democratic #Republican #believe #end 
        
    But while I believe that, I still feel that the Democratic Party represents me, in this area, more than the Republican Party does. [5]
        
    What I am asking of the Democratic Party is simply that you go back to boldly advocating what you believe in. [5]
        
    Of course I know that the Democrats are no more responsible for that than the Republicans are, but the point is that the person who promised to put an end to it was a Republican. [5]
        
    The Democratic Party has never really reclaimed its liberal heart or its progressive soul -- and you need to do that. [5]
        
    Just weeks ago, the liberal world in which I mostly live was certain that the Republican Party was about the self - destruct. [5]
        
    


#lived #spent #Edward #months #years 
        
    Edward, who asked that his last name be withheld, spent months at a time in the Philippines over the course of several years. [1]
        
    And according to Edward, Anglin had another motivation : "He was going out there to marry two 16-year - old Muslim girls. [1]
        
    But Gersh had lived in Whitefish for more than 20 years, since just after college, and had always considered the scenic ski town an idyllic place. [1]
        
    In 2011, he spent several weeks in a small village in southern Mindanao among the T'boli people, who live around mountain lakes covered in lotus blossoms. [1]
        
    Anglin established a home base at the Sampaguita Tourist Inn, a $ 10-a - night hotel in Davao City, where he lived for months at a time off money his father sent. [1]
        
    


#Lauda #Hamilton #Hunt #title #Driving 
        
    Driving for Ferrari, he looked to retain his title in 1976 and was dominating the campaign ahead of James Hunt in his McLaren. [2]
        
    Lauda came back to win the title again in 1977 and then, having temporarily retired, he won it for a third time in 1984, driving for McLaren. [2]
        
    From the famous rivalry with James Hunt in the 1970s, as depicted in the film Rush, to working with Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes, Lauda's career helped define modern F1. [2]
        
    Maurice Hamilton, who first met Lauda in 1971, draws together the remarkable story of one of the greatest stars in Formula One history. [2]
        
    The most comprehensive and detailed biography of Formula One legend Nick Lauda ever published, as told by Maurice Hamilton, who knew him for more than forty years. [2]
        
    


#foot #visitors #site #article #FBI 
        
    He and Auernheimer often bragged that it got millions of unique visitors a month, but comScore put the site's monthly visitors closer to 70,000. [1]
        
    Before that article came out, he falsely accused me on The Daily Stormer of fabricating information from the FBI regarding his whereabouts. [1]
        
    He had a complex about being short -- he claims to be 5 foot 7, but several people I talked with put his height closer to 5 foot 4. [1]
        
    


#court #troll #post #Gersh 
        
    It could force the courts to decide whether calling for a troll attack -- Anglin's admonition to "hit 'em up"--is protected speech. [1]
        
    The risk, however, is that if Anglin prevails in court, sadistic trolls will be free to tear across the internet with even greater abandon. [1]
        
    In April, Tanya Gersh and the Southern Poverty Law Center sued Anglin in federal court for invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and violation of a Montana anti - intimidation statute. [1]
        
    But Sherry claimed that Gersh had issued "terrible threats," and she wrote a post on Medium on December 15 accusing her of an attempted shakedown. [1]
        
    Anglin later posted a photo of my note and accused me of engaging in a "vicious scorched - earth campaign" to threaten his family and friends. [1]
